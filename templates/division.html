<h2 class="content-subhead">Dividing Binary Numbers</h2>

<p>
Binary division follows the same logic as long division in decimal. The steps involve checking how many times the divisor fits into the dividend — only now, you're working with just <strong>1</strong> and <strong>0</strong>. Borrowing and subtraction still happen, just like in base-10.
</p>

<h3>Binary Division Rules</h3>
<p>Before we begin, remember these basic operations:</p>
<ul>
    <li><code>0 ÷ 1 = 0</code></li>
    <li><code>1 ÷ 1 = 1</code></li>
    <li><code>1 ÷ 0</code> → <em>undefined</em> (just like in decimal)</li>
    <li><strong>Division is a repeated subtraction process</strong></li>
</ul>

<h3>Example: Divide 110100 by 110</h3>
<p>
We'll walk through dividing <code>110100</code> (which is 52 in decimal) by <code>110</code> (which is 6 in decimal).
</p>

<ol>
    <li>Start with the leftmost digits of the dividend until you have a number equal or greater than the divisor.</li>
    <li>Divide that portion, subtract the divisor, and bring down the next bit.</li>
    <li>Repeat the process until no more bits remain.</li>
</ol>

<p>
The full process mimics the way you’d do decimal long division — just with 0s and 1s. At each step, you check if the current portion is large enough to subtract the divisor.
</p>

<h3>Final Answer</h3>
<p>
The quotient of <code>110100 ÷ 110</code> is <code>111</code> (which is 7 in decimal), and the remainder is <code>0</code>. You can verify this by multiplying: <code>111 × 110 = 110100</code>.
</p>

<h3>How to Check Your Answer</h3>
<p>
To verify binary division, convert both the dividend and divisor to decimal. Perform normal division and convert the result back to binary. This is a great way to double-check your work!

<h3>Floating Point numbers</h3>
<p>
Our project supports binary division with both whole numbers and fractional results. When a division produces a non-integer result, we calculate and display its binary float equivalent. This is an advanced concept that’s rarely explained clearly, so we included this educational video and summary to help users understand how fractional binary works and how the conversion is done step by step.
