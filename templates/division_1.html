<h2 class="content-subhead">Dividing Binary Numbers</h2>

<p>
Binary division follows the same logic as long division in decimal. The steps involve checking how many times the divisor fits into the dividend — only now, you're working with just <strong>1</strong> and <strong>0</strong>. Borrowing and subtraction still happen, just like in base-10.
</p>

<h3>Binary Division Rules</h3>
<p>Before we begin, remember these basic operations:</p>
<ul>
    <li><code>0 ÷ 1 = 0</code></li>
    <li><code>1 ÷ 1 = 1</code></li>
    <li><code>1 ÷ 0</code> → <em>undefined</em> (just like in decimal)</li>
    <li><strong>Division is a repeated subtraction process</strong></li>
</ul>

<h3>Example: Divide 110100 by 110</h3>
<p>
We'll walk through dividing <code>110100</code> (which is 52 in decimal) by <code>110</code> (which is 6 in decimal).
</p>

<ol>
    <li>Start with the leftmost digits of the dividend until you have a number equal or greater than the divisor.</li>
    <li>Divide that portion, subtract the divisor, and bring down the next bit.</li>
    <li>Repeat the process until no more bits remain.</li>
</ol>

<p>
The full process mimics the way you’d do decimal long division — just with 0s and 1s. At each step, you check if the current portion is large enough to subtract the divisor.
</p>

<h3>Final Answer</h3>
<p>
The quotient of <code>110100 ÷ 110</code> is <code>111</code> (which is 7 in decimal), and the remainder is <code>0</code>. You can verify this by multiplying: <code>111 × 110 = 110100</code>.
</p>

<h3>How to Check Your Answer</h3>
<p>
To verify binary division, convert both the dividend and divisor to decimal. Perform normal division and convert the result back to binary. This is a great way to double-check your work!
